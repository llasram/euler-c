# euler-c

Solutions to various Project Euler problems in C (C99) using only the C standard
library and GCC extensions.

Each solution is a separate single self-contained C source file building a
self-contained executable.  A Ruby test suite verifies program output versus
correct solutions.

Build and test all solutions with:

    make test
