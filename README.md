# euler-c

Solutions to various Project Euler problems, in C (C11), using only the C
standard library and GCC extensions.

Each solution is expressed as a separate single self-contained C source file
building a self-contained executable.  A Ruby test suite verifies program output
versus the accepted solutions.

## Usage

Build and test all solutions with:

    make test
